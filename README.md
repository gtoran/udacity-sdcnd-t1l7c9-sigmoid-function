[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

## Synopsis

This repository contains code used in Lesson 7 - Chapter 9 of Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree (Term 1).

## Goal

The goal of the quiz is to define the forward method in Miniflow (a very basic version of TensorFlow) in the Linear class. Based on the previous lesson, build *forward()* to handle a sigmoid function, as shown below.

## Expected Results

The supplied nn.py file creates the following arrays:

`
[[-1., -2.], [-1, -2]]
[[2., -3], [2., -3]]
[-3., -5]
`

The expected output is:

`
[[  1.23394576e-04   9.82013790e-01]
 [  1.23394576e-04   9.82013790e-01]]
`
